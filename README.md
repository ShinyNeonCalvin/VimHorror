# About

I was not able to find a way to post a screenshot that actually
looks the way it does. Just try it.

Colors used:

-bright red

-dark red (for background in highlights and tabs)

-bright green

-bright orange

-yellow

-white

-light grey

Very easy un-install if you don't like it:

<pre><code>
rm -rf ~/.vim/pack/ShinyNeonCalvin/start/VimHorror
</pre></code>

# Install for linux/mac

Copy these commands to your terminal:

<pre><code>
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/ShinyNeonCalvin/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/ShinyNeonCalvin/start
git clone https://github.com/ShinyNeonCalvin/VimHorror
</pre></code>
